# AR Psychotherapy with Empathetic Therapist Avatar

A mobile app that enables immersive, cost-efficient psychotherapy experiences. This app works with the Algorithmic Human Development Group at Imperial College London to provide Self-Initiated Humour Protocol (SIHP) as the form of psychotherapy. Users interact with an LLM-driven therapist avatar capable of recognizing emotional tone and speech through AI/ML models in real-time. Based on these insights, the avatar provides personalised self-intervention exercises to support users’ mental well-being.
